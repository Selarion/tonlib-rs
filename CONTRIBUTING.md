- Before creating a PR, run the test suite to ensure everything works as expected:

> **__NOTE__**: that some tests in ```tonlib-client``` are dependent on the current load of TON blockchain and may be flacky if the load is relatively high. 
It is recommended to run tests with  ```cargo nextest run --retries=10```
